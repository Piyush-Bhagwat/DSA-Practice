/* Explanation

Here we used two loops. First one starts with i=0 and
goes up to i= root(n), this loop prints the factor less
than root(n) of n from pair of factors (like 3x10=30, will print 3).
Itâ€™s very basic condition.

The second loop starts from i=root(n) and goes up to i=0.
This loop prints the other factor from pair of factors of n.
if n=30 then the pairs be like (1x30/1=30, 3x30/3=10, 5x30/5=6)
so the smaller once are already printed now if i divides n then
we will simply print n/I this will give us the other factor.
And that condition (i! = n/i) is to avoid printing same factors again
